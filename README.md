# SimpleGames

#### You gonna find some simple games made using HTML, CSS and Javascript in it which were made by me as minor projects while pursuing an skill development internship at my college MSRIT.
 - The First game is of dice roll in which there are 2 dices and as a person click on roll the dice button the numbers on both the dice changes and computer will tell which player won. Doesn't this save our effort to store the small dices everytime for playing games like Ludo and looks cool.

 -  The second game is of stone paper scissor which is basically a tossing game which probably many of you had played in your childhood.So basically the user task is to choose between stone/paper/scissor and the counterpart is chosen by the computer following which the winner is decided. But you know whats the most interesting part is?? Its actually the score board which will be recording your and computers number of wins. So you now dont have to remember the counts. Isn't that cool??

 -  The third game is a online drum kit which user can play either by tapping the keyboard keys or by clicking up on the drum images. Main feature in this project is the addition of various sounds for each key. Now what are you witing for, Just choose a song and play your rythm!!.

 -  The fourth game is the famous Simon Game which is popular for increasing the concentration and focus of an individual. The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
 In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.
 1- At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.
 2- The player has to press the same key.
 3- Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.
 4- The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.
 5- And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.
 6- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!
