# SimpleGames

#### You gonna find some simple games made using HTML, CSS and Javascript in it which were made by me as minor projects while pursuing an skill development internship at my college MSRIT.
 - The First game is of dice roll in which there are 2 dices and as a person click on roll the dice button the numbers on both the dice changes and computer will tell which player won. Doesn't this save our effort to store the small dices everytime for playing games like Ludo and looks cool.

 -  The second game is of stone paper scissor which is basically a tossing game which probably many of you had played in your childhood.So basically the user task is to choose between stone/paper/scissor and the counterpart is chosen by the computer following which the winner is decided. But you know whats the most interesting part is?? Its actually the score board which will be recording your and computers number of wins. So you now dont have to remember the counts. Isn't that cool??
